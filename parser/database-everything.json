The 8 hectares were planted in the seventies on 930 m.a.s.l altitude, with vines on VSP Trellis system and Pre-phylloxera rootstock . average production is 6.000 kg /ha. Furrow irrigation system, one of the oldest methods is used to irrigate . This vineyard of 6.000 planting density. Well-drained alluvial soil of composed silt and limestone; A mixed texture with great oenological potential: shallow topsoil provides freshness, but the subsoil of stones and chalk limits growth, so that the vines produce smaller grapes with intensified flavours of complexity and depth.\r\nDry and arid, with annual rainfall of just 200mm. The vineyard is close to the Mendoza river and benefits from the fresh breezes off the Andes, which generate a diurnal temperature variation (14C), ideal for a quality vineyard. With hot days and cold nights, we achieve good levels of sugar, while conserving the acidity, colour and aromas of the grapes.",

Despite five name changes, prohibition, and the catastrophic San Simeon Earthquake, York Mountain Winery ran continuously for 119 years, making it one of the longest continuously run wineries in the United States. When we purchased the property in 2010, the site of the York family\u2019s original vineyard was fallow, but we were eager to one day plants vines on these historic soils again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2015, after much dreaming and planning, we began planting vines at this \u201ccool climate\u201d site (colder than Burgundy). Located just seven miles from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 1,500 feet, this property falls in the small 640 acre York Mountain AVA, which is outside of the very large Paso Robles AVA.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe soils and climate are very different than our other two vineyards. The combination of sandstone soils (some areas look like you are on the beach) with a very moderate climate due to the even closer proximity to the Pacific Ocean make this site quite the departure from our Paderewski and Catapult Vineyards. Because of its elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen deciding what to plant, we wanted to keep with what we know and love best, but we also decided to experiment a bit too. We planted mostly Syrah and Grenache with the hopes of crafting pure varietal expressions of these two Rh\u00f4ne grapes on our very different terroir. In addition, we grow a small amount of Viognier, Roussanne, Zinfandel, and for the first time ever, Cabernet. We love the spice, fresh fruit, and bright acidity York Mountain Vineyard brings out in these varieties.",

This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier\r\n\r\nYork Mountain Vineyard:\r\n\r\nThe York family had vineyards on this mountain, and now we do too! In the spring of 2015, after much dreaming and planning, we began planting vines at this \u201ccool climate\u201d site (colder than Burgundy). Located just seven miles from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 1,500 feet, this property falls in the small 640 acre York Mountain AVA, which is outside of the very large Paso Robles AVA.\r\n\r\nThe soils and climate are very different than our other two vineyards; we get to try our hand at sand and sandstone soils (some areas look like you are on the beach) along with a very moderate climate due to the even closer proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Due to the elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2015 Acreage: 21 under vine, 128 total Soils: sand, fragmented and fractured sandstone pH: high 4s to mid 6s AVA: York Mountain Red Varietals: Grenache, Syrah, Zinfandel, and Cabernet Sauvignon White Varietals: Viognier and Roussanne.\r\n",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s.

Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow.

In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d.

Due to the elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2015 Acreage: 21 under vine, 128 total Soils: sand, fragmented and fractured sandstone pH: high 4s to mid 6s AVA: York Mountain Red Varietals: Grenache, Syrah, Zinfandel, and Cabernet Sauvignon White Varietals: Viognier and Roussanne.",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d.

Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow.

In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

It is an experience to watch Epoch\u2019s White evolve and develop over time, and this wine should continue to impress and move the needle for the potential of Rh\u00f4ne white blends for 10-plus years.",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d.

In the spring of 2015, after much dreaming and planning, we began planting vines at this \u201ccool climate\u201d site (colder than Burgundy). Located just seven miles from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 1,500 feet, this property falls in the small 640 acre York Mountain AVA, which is outside of the very large Paso Robles AVA.\r\n\r\nThe soils and climate are very different than our other two vineyards; we get to try our hand at sand and sandstone soils (some areas look like you are on the beach) along with a very moderate climate due to the even closer proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Due to the elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2015 Acreage: 21 under vine, 128 total Soils: sand, fragmented and fractured sandstone pH: high 4s to mid 6s AVA: York Mountain Red Varietals: Grenache, Syrah, Zinfandel, and Cabernet Sauvignon White Varietals: Viognier and Roussanne",

Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nYork Mountain Vineyard:\r\n\r\nThe York family had vineyards on this mountain, and now we do too! In the spring of 2015, after much dreaming and planning, we began planting vines at this \u201ccool climate\u201d site (colder than Burgundy). Located just seven miles from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 1,500 feet, this property falls in the small 640 acre York Mountain AVA, which is outside of the very large Paso Robles AVA.\r\n\r\nThe soils and climate are very different than our other two vineyards; we get to try our hand at sand and sandstone soils (some areas look like you are on the beach) along with a very moderate climate due to the even closer proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Due to the elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2015 Acreage: 21 under vine, 128 total Soils: sand, fragmented and fractured sandstone pH: high 4s to mid 6s AVA: York Mountain Red Varietals: Grenache, Syrah, Zinfandel, and Cabernet Sauvignon White Varietals: Viognier and Roussanne",

In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow.

In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

In the early 1900\u2019s, this vineyard was cherished and farmed by world-renowned pianist, Polish diplomat, and vintner, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Fast forward a century, and this property stood forgotten and fallow. Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

Lucky for us, in 2004, we became the stewards of this amazing piece of property.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2004 Acreage: 95 under vine, 570 total Soils: limestone, calcareous, rocky pH: low to mid 8 AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourvedre, Petite Sirah, Syrah, Tempranillo, and Zinfandel White Varietals: Grenache Blanc, Picpoul Blanc, and Viognier\r\n\r\nCatapult Vineyard:\r\n\r\nDirectly in the heart of the Paso Robles\u2019 Templeton Gap, near the acclaimed L\u2019Aventure and Booker Vineyards, sits our Catapult Vineyard. In 2008 we came across 45 barren acres of extreme rocky soils packed with silicious shale and little limestone content. Just the type of soils we love; soils that encourage the vines to struggle while finding nourishment deep within the ground. The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d. This pH difference, coupled with the cooler mesoclimate at Catapult allows for different flavor profiles from the fruit produced.\r\n\r\nPlanted: 2008 Acreage: 28 under vine, 45 total Soils: shale, clay, silt, rocky pH: high 5s AVA: Paso Robles District: Willow Creek Red Varietals: Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre, Syrah, and Tempranillo White Varietals: Grenache Blanc,Roussane, and Viognier",

The coolness of the \u201911 vintage is apparent in the brightness of fruit and acid in this wine as well as its tight tannin structure.

However, there\u2019s a remarkable freshness and purity that lets the vineyard in this 100% Paderewski blend shine brightly through that boisterous fruit and spice. With lively sensation moving from lush fruit to rocky texture and bright acid, there is a swooshing sensation around the palate as it reveals black and blue fruits, ripe mandarin orange, warm underbrush, resinous lavender, crushed rocks, fresh cream, and vanilla/ clove spice. This wine is hedonism practicing well-appointed restraint.",

Despite five name changes, prohibition, and the catastrophic San Simeon Earthquake, York Mountain Winery ran continuously for 119 years, making it one of the longest continuously run wineries in the United States. When we purchased the property in 2010, the site of the York family\u2019s original vineyard was fallow, but we were eager to one day plants vines on these historic soils again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2015, after much dreaming and planning, we began planting vines at this \u201ccool climate\u201d site (colder than Burgundy). Located just seven miles from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 1,500 feet, this property falls in the small 640 acre York Mountain AVA, which is outside of the very large Paso Robles AVA.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe soils and climate are very different than our other two vineyards. The combination of sandstone soils (some areas look like you are on the beach) with a very moderate climate due to the even closer proximity to the Pacific Ocean make this site quite the departure from our Paderewski and Catapult Vineyards. Because of its elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen deciding what to plant, we wanted to keep with what we know and love best, but we also decided to experiment a bit too. We planted mostly Syrah and Grenache with the hopes of crafting pure varietal expressions of these two Rh\u00f4ne grapes on our very different terroir. In addition, we grow a small amount of Viognier, Roussanne, Zinfandel, and for the first time ever, Cabernet. We love the spice, fresh fruit, and bright acidity York Mountain Vineyard brings out in these varieties.",

Despite five name changes, prohibition, and the catastrophic San Simeon Earthquake, York Mountain Winery ran continuously for 119 years, making it one of the longest continuously run wineries in the United States. When we purchased the property in 2010, the site of the York family\u2019s original vineyard was fallow, but we were eager to one day plants vines on these historic soils again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2015, after much dreaming and planning, we began planting vines at this \u201ccool climate\u201d site (colder than Burgundy). Located just seven miles from the Pacific Ocean at an elevation of 1,500 feet, this property falls in the small 640 acre York Mountain AVA, which is outside of the very large Paso Robles AVA.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe soils and climate are very different than our other two vineyards. The combination of sandstone soils (some areas look like you are on the beach) with a very moderate climate due to the even closer proximity to the Pacific Ocean make this site quite the departure from our Paderewski and Catapult Vineyards. Because of its elevation and distance from the ocean, York Mountain receives more than twice the amount of rainfall as our other vineyards and has characteristic foggy mornings throughout the year with cool breezes all day long.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen deciding what to plant, we wanted to keep with what we know and love best, but we also decided to experiment a bit too. We planted mostly Syrah and Grenache with the hopes of crafting pure varietal expressions of these two Rh\u00f4ne grapes on our very different terroir. In addition, we grow a small amount of Viognier, Roussanne, Zinfandel, and for the first time ever, Cabernet. We love the spice, fresh fruit, and bright acidity York Mountain Vineyard brings out in these varieties.",

The reward of this hardworking vine are berries packed with wicked complexity and intense flavors.\r\n\r\nThough barely three miles from our Paderewski Vineyard, the pH level at Catapult Vineyard is in the high 5\u2019s. A nice complement to the dirt over at \u201cRewski\u201d.

Production levels were excellent, above long term averages and the mild & slow ripening conditions enabled strong varietal character to develop.  Vintage was dry and the weather stable so fruit was harvested, at optimal flavour development and high natural acidity.",
